### TECHNICAL DESIGN FOR PRODUCT & SYSTEMS

My skills & interests blend the boundary between designer & developer, using technology to evolve & push design experiences to ever higher standards; from simple UI mock-ups to immersive preproduction prototypes, my rare hybrid skill sets combine cutting-edge AI, web technologies (HTML/CSS/TypeScript), lower level software (C#/C++/Python) as well as hardware design (SolidWorks/EagleCAD/Fabrication).
I thrive in a position where I can lead prototyping & design efforts in an organisation, promoting the mindset of rapid design iterations, learning from mistakes & crafting experiences. My passion is to harmonise design & engineering teams to allow for seamless collaborations, culminating in incredibly well crafted, compelling products & services.

## MICROSOFT

### SENIOR UX ENGINEER

_2019 - PRESENT_

As a core member of the Developer Division Design team, I focus on scaling the impact of designers through the creation of tools, interactive resources, & prototypes for use in complex, technical products, such as Visual Studio. I frequently experiment with emerging technologies to improve design workflows & promote accessibility standards, as well as bring UX & UI designs to life through a variety of prototyping techniques & fidelities for use in customer studies & concept validation.
As the senior member of my team, I coach & mentor fellow Design Developers to help them navigate ambiguous problems & develop the relevant skills & relationships for projects & career growth. I also advocate for prototyping within the larger D3 studio through several initiatives, including leading a v-team for Figma prototyping techniques & sharing related learnings with the wider Microsoft design community.

## PRODUCT DESIGN BSc (HONS) – 1st

### DUNDEE UNIVERSITY

_2006 – 2010_

The evolution of existing & emergence of new technologies has profound implications for products, the people who use them & the cultures in which they are placed. At the Product Design course at Dundee University, we were interested in the design of products in the rapidly changing technological, economic & social landscape.
Our philosophy was simple – we aimed to:

- Make products that work socially, through deep understanding of people & society.
- Work technically, through embedding cutting-edge technology into our products.
- Work economically, through working closely with global industries to ensure a market readiness & entrepreneurship at the highest level.

## OUTSIDE OF WORK

When I am not being kept busy with my twin daughters, I enjoy exploring a wide selection of topics that combine the artistic with the technical, including cooking, homebrewing, building interactive objects for the home & discovering new genres of music – from doom metal to 70’s Japanese jazz, & beyond.

I am a maker at heart: love bringing things to life & seeing the effect it has on people. I believe expressing yourself & your ideas through any medium – whether it’s a home cooked meal, or an immersive prototype – is a skill that enables us to connect to each other on a deeper level & is a skill I want to encourage others, especially my children, to develop.
