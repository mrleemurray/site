A tool to record mobile device interactions.

An adjustable USB camera & application to improve recording mobile device interactions in more context & aid in UX testing. Developed at Nokia for use in their global design studios.

To avoid screen glare from the recorded devices, a polarizing filter was added. For finer control of the camera itself, we developed a bespoke application to expose all firmware configuration settings, usually hidden by off-the-shelf applications.
