An exploration into voyeurism & CCTV.

A public access CCTV viewer exploring the social boundaries within surveillance. Viewers insert £1 for 10 minutes of access, can select a local CCTV feed using the front dial & explore the footage using the side knobs. Powered by Arduino & Processing, the project was my final year piece at University.
