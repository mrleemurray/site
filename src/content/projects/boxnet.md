*"How do you get a good collaboration? Well, egos? You've got to park them. You've got to leave those parts at the front door. It's not going to be helpful in a process, so leave them. Share like BFFs. You're gonna have to be like you're best friends. You're going to row, you're going to argue, you're going to have to be honest at times but that's what best friends do, but you can get past it, right? So share like BFFs, it really does help. Fast, cheap, good. Pick two. You're not gonna have all three if you're really honest with each other. You can be honest with a client and honest with the agency, you can do these things. Has anyone seen this? It was Hugh Dubberly that used to run the Netscape design team who first showed me this, and I think it's such a simple way of taking a bit of the pressure off on projects. When you think this through, most projects fall into this kind of thing and I think it's really helpful."*
