# Aether

An open source air quality monitoring device & software, powered by .NET 6.

Part of Microsoft global hackathon 2021.

## Overview

As part of the virtual distributed team, I led the design & development of the 3D printed enclosure. Over the hackathonâ€™s three day duration I created all CAD files for the prototype. 

::: info Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, development of the enclosure was completely virtual, with no access to 3D printing facilities. When eventually printed, the resulting parts all fit together & housed the electronic parts perfectly, which is rare. :::
