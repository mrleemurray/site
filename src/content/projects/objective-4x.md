A purpose built panning rig to film everyday objects through a microscope.

To create a panning rig that was slow & smooth enough to keep the camera in focus, stepper motors with 1000:1 gear reductions were used & an Arduino was added to control the direction & speed of the motion.

We’re always on the lookout for obscure sources of inspiration, novel ways to generate imagery, and new technologies to exploit. Jimmy Irwin, one of our in-house Directors, has been experimenting with filmmaking with a microscope. He worked with our Technical Director Lee Murray to build a custom rig. The result? Slowed down and microscopic, even the mundane has an astonishing beauty.
